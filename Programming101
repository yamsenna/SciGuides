OPERATIONS
 -Arithmetic Operators
name	symbol	example
plus	+	5 + 9 → 14
minus	-	8 - 4 → 4
times	*	8 * 2 → 16
divided by	/	20 / 4 → 5
modulo	%	5 % 2 → 1

MODULUS

n	n % 2
EVEN: 0
ODD: 1

COMPARISON OPERATORS
name	symbol	example
equals	==	5 == 5 → true
greater than	>	8 > 8 → false
less than	<	8 < 10 → true
greater than or equals	>=	8 >= 8 → true
less than or equals	<=	8 <= 5 → false
not equals	!=	5 != 5 → false
